# SSBU Dumped Scripts
Dumped using Rubendal's script dumping tool: https://github.com/rubendal/SSBU-Dump-Scripts

# Usage
Scripts in the `smashline` and `smashline-hdr` folder are in a (mostly) usable state right out of the gate.
Errors still exist, so don't expect everything to be copy and paste!

Scripts in the `smashline` folder are written explicitly in a verbose manner.
These can be directly used with my smashline-acmd template, found below.
https://github.com/WuBoytH/skyline-rs-template/tree/smash_smashline

Scripts in the `smashline-hdr` folder are formatted in a way to be used when
developing for HewDraw Remix, removing some verbosity for the sake of shorthand.

Scripts in the `skyline-acmd` folder are meant for the legacy skyline-acmd formatting,
and should not be used when smashline exists.
