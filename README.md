# SSBU Dumped Scripts
Dumped using Rubendal's script dumping tool: https://github.com/rubendal/SSBU-Dump-Scripts

# Usage
Scripts in the `smashline` and `smashline-hdr` folder are in a (mostly) usable state right out of the gate.
Errors still exist, so don't expect everything to be copy and paste!

Scripts in the `smashline` folder are written explicitly in a verbose manner.
It should be easy to copy and paste those if you are using my smashline-acmd template, found below.
